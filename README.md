A failed attempt at implementing the Wave function Collapse algorithm while trying to generate a 2D terrain in processing.

Please do not read through the code if you want to keep your eyes safe. I find Wave function collapse algorithm as a very interesting algorithms to try out in different fields. To learn more about it please watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY)



This is the output of the code that I wrote in case you want to see why I even decided to upload it to github
